# Projects
some projects I've worked on or am working on right now, also some ideas for future projects. most (if not all) are backend projects and open source.

most of them done on youtube, you can check them out on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAbdusalam).

## In Progress
- [**PConnector**](https://github.com/theabdusalam/pconnector) - A simple implementation of a peer to peer file sharing system.

## Finished
- [**Omr - optical mark recognition**](https://github.com/theabdusalam/omr-fastapi) - A fastapi based web app that uses opencv to recognize and grade multiple choice questions.
- [**Boodbood - a smarter way to cd**](https://github.com/theabdusalam/boodbood) - A zsh plugin that makes it easier to navigate your filesystem faster.
- [**Flight Ticketing System**](https://github.com/TheAbdusalam/flight_ticketing_gui) - A flight ticketing system with a GUI made with you guessed it JAVA(i was forced to btw, java sucks).

## Future Ideas
- **A Interpreter for a simple language** - To learn how interpreters work, maybe write a simple language and write an interpreter for it.

- **$hell** - A shell written in zig, add very dumb features, like echo always prints "hello world\n + whatever you passed to it".
- **Text editor** - A text editor in WHAT language? I don't know yet, but I want to write a text editor. inspired by [ded](https://github.com/tsoding/ded).
